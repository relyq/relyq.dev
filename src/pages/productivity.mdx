# PRODUCTIVITY GUIDE
## on tasks and knowledge
there are two things that move your life forward whether you're aware of it or not, these are tasks and knowledge \
the main difference is that tasks are actionable, and knowledge is not

<div>
- tasks
  - are actionable
  - have a priority
  - have a due date
  - might be part of a bigger task or project
  - are better kept in a system that lets you sort them by priority or due date
</div>

<div>
- knowledge
  - you can't act on knowledge
  - it might be needed to perform tasks
  - there are intricate relationships between information bits
  - builds on top of itself
  - is better kept in a knowledgebase system with a robust linking, tagging, and searching system
</div>

## the 2 minute rule & postponing tasks
think of the moment when you get an idea or remember a task as a moment of enlightenment \
you must make the most of that clarity by either acting on the task if it takes \<2 minutes, or writing it down for later if it can't possibly be completed now

this is directly related to the idea of context switching

## on context & context switching
one of the core ideas of my productivity thinking is that context switching is the hardest part of a task

<div>
- "context" can be defined as all the information needed to bring a task to completion
  - ex. all taken measurements when designing parts
  - ex. people to contact and what to tell them to delegate a task
  - ex. the cost of an item you plan on purchasing
</div>

<div>
- whenever you drop a task to do it later, you also drop all the context with it
  - the effect of this is that some work will be lost - you will have to start over to regain part of the lost context
</div>

<div>
- if you're already in the context of the task it's better to do it now as switching contexts will be the highest barrier to complete it later
  - this is why sometimes we feel an extremely high level of friction (read friction below) for a task that is trivial once in context of the task
    - once you switched back to the context of the task, the actual work that must be performed is very simple to do - the actual difficulty was in switching back to the task's context
</div>

<div>
- some tasks can't possibly be done at this precise moment - they must be dropped for later
  - to prevent context loss, you can dump all the context to a piece of paper for later use, when the task becomes available
    - this means writing down all the information related to the task that you will need to get yourself back in the task frame
</div>

## on motivation & friction

if “motivation” is what makes you do productive stuff when your energy is high, the thing that makes you feel opposed to it when your energy is low is “friction”

<div>
- friction is an abstract term - it’s anything that makes it a hassle or inconvenient to achieve your goals, like preparing the healthy meals when dieting, like not having a routine or not knowing what the exercises are when working out
  - for me, friction usually appears when a goal is nebulous. whenever i don’t have a concrete plan, i feel opposed. divide and conquer works really well for me in eliminating friction
</div>

<div>
- friction is actually more of a feeling. you will learn to recognise it and come to know the feeling once you become aware of it
</div>

<div>
- usually when motivated you are over-energised, so you can overcome the friction, do the activity, and still have some energy left - you still want to do more
  - you should use this extra energy to proactively remove the friction from your system so that you will keep it up when the motivation wears off
  - ex. if you use your high energy periods to meal prep, eating healthy will just be more convenient than not
  - ex. when you’re just starting the gym and highly motivated, write down your program and what each exercise means, along with anything that will make going to the gym an unambiguous activity with a concrete plan
</div>
