spent a few hours learning a bit of ci/cd before deploying a webapp to aws as i figured it would be useful \
took a bit to figure each job ran on its own instance so they didnt share artifacts but now updates to this site are deployed automatically \
the repo might not be public yet but here's the workflow file: https://github.com/relyq/relyq.dev/blob/master/.github/workflows/astro.yml
