# LEARNING RESISTANCE TRAINING (the way i did)
the goal of this guide is for you to understand the anatomy information at the end by performing movements - understanding this will give you the freedom to build your own program

there's a link at the bottom that contains tables with exercises and the muscle groups they use

<div>
- this is aimed at understanding movement and mechanics
  - not focused on learning training goals (hypertrophy, strength, endurance, power)
- the goal is to learn enough to prepare your own program
- doesn't include small joints (neck, wrists, ankles)
- doesn't include supination/pronation (but honestly could, ex. underhand overhand grips)
- doesn't cover specifics like supersets, dropsets, warm-ups, rests, recovery, myo-reps, partials (yet)
</div>

<div>
- choose a split depending on schedule
  - at least 2x same muscle groups
  - 6 days, push/pull/legs
  - 4 days, upper/lower
  - 2 days, full body
- always think of movements as push/pull
</div>

<div>
- first learn the movements
  - only bodyweight and machine work
  - push/pull/legs split
    - push: triceps, chest, shoulders
    - pull: biceps, back, forearms
    - legs: quads/hamstrings, adductors/abductors, calves
  - your priority will be learning how the movements work, and which muscles they work
  - once you understand working muscles, improve form & feel the working muscles
  - as you'll be doing only bodyweight and machines, there's little risk of injury from poor form
</div>

<div>
- learn which are the main movements
  - push
    - machine: chest press, shoulder press
    - bodyweight: push-up, handstand/pike push-up
  - pull
    - machine: pulldown, row
    - bodyweight: pullup/chinup, inverted row
  - legs
    - machine: leg press
    - bodyweight: squat
</div>

<div>
- then learn which are the accessory/isolation lifts
  - push: tricep pushdown, tricep extension, chest fly
  - pull: bicep curl, reverse fly
  - legs: leg extension, hamstring curl, calf raise, hip abduction, hip adduction
  - additionally: lateral and front raises
    - these don't fit on push/pull framework
</div>

<div>
- then learn the main movements on barbell and dumbbells/kettlebells
  - push: bench press, overhead press
  - pull: bent-over row
  - legs: barbell squat, deadlift
</div>

<div>
- at this point you should have a solid foundation & understand joints, antagonistic muscle pairs, types of movements, and concentric/eccentric contractions
  - for each joint, there are two antagonistic pairs, which perform opposite movements
    - flexion/extension: decreasing/increasing the angle of the joint
    - adduction/abduction: moving toward or away from the body's midline
  - at the elbow joint
    - biceps perform flexion (pull)
    - triceps perform extension (push)
  - at the knee joint
    - hamstrings perform flexion
    - quadriceps perform extension
  - at the shoulder
    - delts preform flexion (shoulder press), and abduction (shoulder raise)
    - lats perform extension (shoulder pulldown), and adduction (shoulder lower)
  - at the hips
    - psoas and quads perform hip flexion (leg raises)
    - glutes and hamstrings perform extension (deadlift, squats)
    - glutes/abductors perform abduction
    - adductors perform adduction (erm)
</div>

<div>
- some muscles (pecs, traps) might be missing due to synergist or stabiliser action
- refer to tables below 
  - for in-depth muscle activation for each movement
  - list of multi-joint/main lifts, and accessory/isolation lifts (not comprehensive) https://chatgpt.com/share/66ee7cdf-2ce0-8012-b679-cee2b7940058
