volumes are a way to keep sync going across multiple categories

  the number of points needed for a channel to be in a category - top category wont have a threshold \

# extras

## points abuse detection

lantern will notify you if a message is deleted less than a minute before posting on a tracked channel

no action will be taken automatically as some of these might be false positives, e.g. a post doesn't look like you want it to

you can punish abuse by `ltn score untrack`'ing channels so they can't win points - which will make them slowly sink down
