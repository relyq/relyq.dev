on nov 2022 i upgraded my desktop pc and repurposed my old build as a homelab server

it runs proxmox ve and hosts a wireguard vpn, a truenas vm, the api & db for [my issue tracker](/projects/tracker), a snipe-it instance, [my discord bot](/projects/blogs_bot), and various game servers, each service on its own linux container

in the process i learned how to set up & manage linux servers (scripting, systemd), networking, and virtualization (VMs, LXCs, docker)
