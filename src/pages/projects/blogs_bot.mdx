this is a plugin i made for the [red discord bot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) which is currently running on a discord server with over 1500 members

red is a modular self-hosted bot made from [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which supports plugins (cogs) to add functionality without needing to run instances of different bots

on [my homelab server](/projects/homelab) i host a discord bot called lantern which runs mainly as an instance of red

the purpose of this plugin is having a bot to manage "blogs", or personal channels for members of the server. it allows members with certain roles to create one or multiple text channels & manage them via the bot's interface
