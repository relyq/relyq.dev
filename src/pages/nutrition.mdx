# MEAL PLANNING
- first of all find your TDEE and macro ratios
  - https://tdeecalculator.net/

- WHOLE FOODS ONLY - MINIMAL PROCESSING
- split servings as you wish
- consider supplements, spices, and herbs
  - multivits to make sure micros are covered
  - omega-3 because it's omega-3 (unless seafood)
  - protein shakes for extra protein
    - liquid protein passes quickly - add fiber for better absorption
  - fiber supplements, ex. psyllium, chia, flax
  - spices, ex. cocoa, cinnamon, ginger
  - herbs & seasonings, ex. basil, parsley, pepper
- note on fiber
  - you should get about enough from the plan, but add more if needed depending on food volume & bowel movements

- the bulk of your protein will come from any animal meat & eggs
  - poultry/beef/fish
    - about 100-200g should be good
  - drink shakes as needed
  - 3 eggs are 100% of your choline needs. have 3 eggs a day

- 1 serving of potato or sweet potato
  - about 100-200g
- at least 4 other different non-starchy vegetables
  - these are more or less free foods in terms of calories
    - except avocadoes. be mindful of calorie dense vegetables
  - 50-100g of each is good
  - should amount to a total 100-200 cal
  - pick whichever you prefer
    - ex. spinach, broccoli, onion, garlic, tomato, mushrooms, cabbage, pepper

- 2 servings of fruit
  - sugar is best before exercising
  - be mindful of calorie dense food
    - sweeter = denser
  - kiwis have proven benefits before sleep
- fill carbs with any whole grains
  - bread/pasta/rice/oats

## MANAGING "CHEAT" DAYS
- idk lol 
- its usually carbs
  - just try to pick protein rich foods and manage portions
- fat is unavoidable eating out
