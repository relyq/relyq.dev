# SELF-IMPROVEMENT GUIDE

- you have to stick to PRINCIPLES by using METHODS that are implemented through SYSTEMS

  - ex. PRINCIPLE - anything important must be written down > METHOD - note down actionable tasks and useful knowledge > SYSTEM - todoist & obsidian

<br></br>

- the feeling of self-determination is what keeps you alive. YOU ARE IN CONTROL

<br></br>

- it's very important to know that you can't IMPROVE YOUR LIFE without CHANGING YOUR LIFE

  - change brings fear, because change means uncertainty, and uncertainty is scary
  - understanding that change is not to be feared is step one towards improving your life

<br></br>

- build a supportive environment

  - ex. physical - meal prep, make the right things be convenient
  - ex. social - be around the right people
  - ex. digital - immerse yourself in the right content and mindset
  - remove & replace things from your environment to progress forward

<br></br>

- MAKE A SCHEDULE YOU WANT TO FOLLOW

  - don't plan an impossible schedule. don't do activities you don't enjoy. try to create a routine that WORKS FOR YOU, not one that is "perfect"
  - consistency is the most important - YOU WON'T KEEP DOING STUFF YOU HATE
  - if you have to do things you don't enjoy, try to do them when most energetic

<br></br>

- MAKE NO EXCUSES to break your schedule. it is sacred

  - no, i won't go out or stay in playing games when im supposed to work out.
  - no, i won't skip the day because i've already been productive enough today.
  - it is sacred

<br></br>

- create habit cues

  - link a daily occurring event to your goal or habit
  - make something that is impossible to miss or already a part of your life be a reminder of a habit you want to build
    - ex. write on a daily visible piece of paper the actions that will make you the person you want to be
    - ex. whenever i see someone look at me on the street i think to myself “what am i looking like? where are my shoulders? am i keeping my neck straight?”

<br></br>

- ORGANIZE YOUR DAY BY ENERGY PERIODS

  - it's most difficult to change state; that is to go from relaxed to focused, so once you're in the zone, try to do as much as you can
  - ex. i do dishes right away before even eating, because i'm already in a focused and energetic state, unlike after eating, which gets me out of it

<br></br>

- MOTIVATION IS A BLESSING - but structure & consistency drive success

  - motivation is a moment of enlightenment, a spark of brilliance
  - when you feel motivated use that golden opportunity to build structure that will help you stay consistent when the motivation wears off (read <a href="/productivity">friction</a>). MOTIVATION WEARS OFF

<br></br>

- TRACK PROGRESS

  - it will create motivation spikes later on

<br></br>

- temptation bundling

<br></br>

- environment alignment
