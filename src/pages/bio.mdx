highly organized \
hit me up on discord @relyq

kinda given up

chronically online

im not offended easily - i like being playfully toxic and i want a girl that will call me a bitch

im a fencer and do épée

im extremely curious and love learning how things work. someday I'll know everything there is to know

i don't take myself too seriously and you shouldnt either

im very ambitious and i want to do absolutely everything but i don't know how to do it

some of the things i like are music (making), linguistics, video games, history, science, engineering, programming, philosophy

i like to be silly sometimes and my jokes often don't make much sense at all

im overly analytical i overthink things so much it's not even healthy

my greatest satisfaction is understanding things

i work in tech - software & electronics

i play guitar and sometimes im even good at it

can mix drinks i had a bartending arc

music taste below

whatever
