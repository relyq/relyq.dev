i do <span class="highlight">fencing</span> & play <span class="highlight">guitar</span> and sometimes im even good at it

im not offended easily ill call u a retard and i expect the same in return

- highly structured

- kinda given up

- chronically online

im extremely curious and love learning how things work. someday I'll know everything there is to know

i refuse to lie. \
"Lying is not saying what isn't true. It is also, in fact especially, saying more than is true, and, in case of the human heart, saying more than one feels."

i don't take myself too seriously and you shouldnt either

im very ambitious and i want to do absolutely everything i just don't know how yet

some of the things i like are <span class="highlight">music (making)</span>, <span class="highlight">linguistics</span>, <span class="highlight">video games</span>, <span class="highlight">history</span>, <span class="highlight">science</span>, <span class="highlight">engineering</span>, <span class="highlight">programming</span>, <span class="highlight">philosophy</span>

- very <span class="highlight">silly</span> - my jokes often don't make much sense at all

- overly <span class="highlight">analytical</span> - i overthink things so much it's not even healthy

- i work with <span class="highlight">software & electronics</span>

- can mix drinks i had a bartending arc

whatever
